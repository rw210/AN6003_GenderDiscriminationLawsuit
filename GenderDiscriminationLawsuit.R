# Result: The full professor level tends to represent a range in 10 to 20 experience years, compared to others which are more concentrated in the range of 5 to 10 years. If focusing on gender, it is found that the male group shows a boarder range of experience years, specifically, its higher median value indicates that men generally have more years of experience compared to women. In this regard, the less presence of females in the full professor position could be explained by their relatively lower experience levels.

  )
# Result: The proportion of doctors with board certified who are full professors is higher than those who are not certified, which implies that doctors who are certified are more likely to become full professors. When focusing on the gender factor, it is found that the overall certification rate of men is higher than that of women. In this regard, the proportion of women with board certified is lower, which would explain why they are underrepresented in full professor positions.

  )
# Result: Regardless of the position, women tends to have less experience than men, which could imply that women are promoted with relatively less experience in the same position, hence, the promotion threshold for women is relatively low.

  )
# Result: In the full professor position, the rate of women without board certified is significantly higher than that of men. It means women presents higher likelihood to be promoted to the full professor position without certificates, which could indicate that the promotion system is more stringent for men.

    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)  
  )
# Result: Women present a relatively higher publication rate compared to men in both assistant and associate levels. However, it drops in the full professor level while the prate of men generally has increased with promotion in positions. Assuming similar quality across gender, the publication efficiency of men increases with promotion, while femaleâ€™s publication efficiency shows a narrowing trend. The discrepancy might explain the preference of promoting male as a prior.

# Result: In the regression model, the GVIF^(1/(2*Df))s of Prate and Clin were 4.202533 and 2.471135 respectively, both showing high multicollinearity. This indicates that there is a significant correlation between these two variables and other independent variables. Other variables have lower VIF values, showing that they have less this problem. Further processing of Prate and Clin is recommended to improve model stability and accuracy.

This indicates that gender does not have a significant effect on salary or salary increments, after accounting for other variables such as experience, certification, department, rank, and clinical research involvement.
